			<p>African lions are mostly found in sub-Saharan Africa. They used to be found all
				 over Africa but now they have mostly disappeared from North Africa and are
				  at risk of extinction in West Africa. Lions live in savannahs and 
				  grasslands, where some cover and plenty of water can be found. African
				   lions once roamed most of Africa and parts of Asia and Europe.
				    But the species has disappeared from 94 percent of its historic 
					range and can only be found today in parts of sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
